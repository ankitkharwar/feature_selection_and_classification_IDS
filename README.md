  <p> The number of attacks increased with speedy development in web communication in the last couple
of years. The anomaly detection method for IDS has become substantial in detecting novel attacks in
intrusion detection systems (IDS). Achieving high accuracy is a significant challenge in designing
an intrusion detection system. It also emphasizes applying different feature selection techniques to
identify the most suitable feature subset. The Different proposed methods are used to solve the problem. The proposed method is estimated on standard datasets KDD CUPâ€™99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CICIS2017
 , and CICIDS2018.  </p>
